<h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Pariots have gave permission for teams to interview Josh McDaniels</h1>
<img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Patriots-news-Josh-McDaniels-expected-to-be-pursued-by-two-NFL-teams.jpg">
<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">The New England Patriots have allowed teams such as the New York Giants, the Cleveland Browns and the Carolina Panthers to interview <strong>Josh McDaniels</strong> for a job as their Head Coach along with Patriot's special teams coordinator and wide receivers coach, <strong>Joe Judge</strong>. McDaniels wasn't aware of teams interest to interview him as recently as Monday. Coaching Canidates who are busy in wildcard weekend are not permitted to be interviewed this week and with McDaniels focused on the game rather than the interviews. “When that stuff is presented to me or discussed with me or whatever, then we’ll deal with it appropriately,’’ he said Monday. “Honestly, it’s pretty easy for me in terms of formula. I’m the offensive coordinator of the Patriots. We have a lot of work to do, we can improve in a lot of areas to try to get ready for this week — our biggest game of the year against, certainly, the best team we’ve played since a postseason game. Our players deserve that, our coaches deserve that, and that’s what they’re going to get from me.’’</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Rumors - Could This Be Tom Brady's Last Game With The Patriots?</h1>
<img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Patriots-news-Tom-Brady-responds-to-Saturday-possibly-being-his-last-game-at-Gillette-Stadium.jpg">
<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">Patriots QB, <strong>Tom Brady</strong>, is on his way to play in wildcard weekend in which the team hasn't been for a decade, being gifted with the bye week for the past 10 years. However, his game is showing signs of <i>mortality</i> after struggling to keep pace with the team's young WR's (rookies) and his inaccurate passes when they needed the ball to open receievers the most. Brady said he wants to play to 45, leaving three more seasons to complete to achieve such a goal. It's possible but it just might not happen in New England. With the team getting ready to face the fearless Titans Saturday at 8:15pm EST, will it be Brady's last game in New England or will he stay to fufill his goal in New England?</p>
