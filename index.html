      <h1>AFC Championship Game</h1>
      <p><i>January 20,2019</i><br> The Patriots would end up winning the AFC Championship Game against the Chiefs with a score of <strong>37-31</strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 17px;">Tom Brady has been on league for 20 years. Showing no signs of aging, he is still able to play an elite level despite his low scoring offense he has since the beginning of the 2018 season.</p><br>

  <h3 style="color: #002145;">Bill Belichick</h3>
    <img src="Images/BillBelichick.jpg" alt="Bill Belichick" class="img3">
  <p style="font-size: 17px;">Bill Belichick has been in the league for 45 years after his father Steve Belichick introduced him to the game while coaching the United States Naval Academy. He would start from the bottom working for his mentor, Bill Parcells, after named Defensive Coordinator, winning 2 titles against the Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills. Belichick would soon start a head coaching job with the Cleveland Browns having little success with just one playoff win which was against his former mentor (Would be Cleveland's last playoff win till this day). He would go to New England and New York to join his former mentor with a trip to Super Bowl XXXI, Bill would later resign from the Head Coaching job a day after Parcells retired as a head coach of the New York Jets until he would return to New England with the Head Coaching job, leading them to 9 super bowl appearances with 6 of them ending with a win.</p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">2019 SEASON</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: white;">The 2019 season has been an impressive year for the defense and special teams. However, Brady and the offense has yet to take themselves in an explosive level after struggling against the Bills, Ravens, Eagles, Texans and Chiefs with their defense stopping this Patriot's Offense.This frustration has led to some questions whether or not if the patriots can even make a deep playoff run with this offense relying on a veteran slot receiver in Jules, Mohamed Sanu, a couple of young wideouts and even a bottom ranked group of Tight Ends. Although these pass catchers have some talent, they can't seem to get the trust of Brady, taking hit after hit afer hit with the amount of time he has been in the pocket.</p>
